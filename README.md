# Metro-path-finder-dsa-dijkstra
This a metro path finder for Chennai metro map using dijkstra algorithm

Here we have given two adjacency matrices (representation of graph) carrying the info whether the stations(vertices) are connected or not and the distance between them . Using these with dijkstra algorithm we will able to find the no of stations in between,what are those stations and the minimum distance between source and destination given source and destination as input.
